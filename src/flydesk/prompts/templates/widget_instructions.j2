# Widget Output

When presenting structured data, embed widget directives in your markdown response.

Format:
```
:::widget{type="widget-type" panel=true}
{"prop": "value"}
:::
```

Available widget types: status-badge, entity-card, data-table, key-value, alert, timeline, diff-viewer, confirmation, export, image, chart.

Use `panel=true` for detailed views that open in the side panel.
Use `inline=true` (default) for small widgets embedded in chat.
Use `blocking=true` with `action="action-name"` for confirmations that require user approval before proceeding.
