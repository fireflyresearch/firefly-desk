# Memories

The agent can remember important information about you across conversations. This allows it to provide personalized responses without you needing to repeat yourself.

## What Gets Remembered

The agent saves memories when you share:

- **Preferences** -- "I prefer dark mode," "Always show me compact tables"
- **Facts** -- "My timezone is EST," "I'm on the payments team"
- **Workflow details** -- "I need manager approval for large orders," "Our deployments happen on Tuesdays"
- **General notes** -- Anything the agent considers useful for future interactions

Memories are organized into categories (general, preference, fact, workflow) so they can be filtered and browsed easily.

## How They Are Used

When you send a message, the agent automatically searches your saved memories for relevant context. If you previously mentioned that you prefer concise responses, the agent will recall that preference and adjust its behavior accordingly.

The agent also recalls memories when you ask about something you have previously discussed, even if it was in a different conversation.

## Managing Memories

Go to **Settings > Memories** to:

- View all saved memories with their content, category, and timestamp
- Search memories by content
- Filter by category (general, preference, fact, workflow)
- Delete any memory you no longer want the agent to remember

## Privacy

- Memories are private to your account -- no other user can see them
- Administrators cannot access your memories
- You can delete any memory at any time from the Settings page
- The agent only saves memories from information you explicitly share in conversation
