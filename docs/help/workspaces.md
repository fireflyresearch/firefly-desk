# Workspaces

Workspaces provide logical isolation for organizing teams, departments, or projects within Firefly Desk. Each workspace can have its own set of users, roles, and scoped resources.

## Creating a Workspace

Click the **+ Create Workspace** button to open the creation form. Each workspace has:

- **Name** -- A human-readable name for the workspace (e.g., "Engineering", "Finance").
- **Description** -- A brief description of the workspace's purpose.
- **Icon** -- Choose from 20+ icons to visually distinguish workspaces in the UI.
- **Color** -- Pick an accent color for the workspace card and branding.

## Managing Members

Each workspace tracks:

- **Users** -- The users assigned to this workspace.
- **Roles** -- The roles available within the workspace scope.

## Editing and Deleting

- Click the pencil icon on a workspace card to edit its name, description, icon, or color.
- Click the trash icon to delete a workspace. Deleting a workspace does not delete the users assigned to it, but removes the workspace scope from resources.

## Tips

- Use workspaces to separate environments (e.g., "Production Support", "Development") with different access levels.
- Workspace-scoped resources (like catalog entries) are only visible to members of that workspace.
